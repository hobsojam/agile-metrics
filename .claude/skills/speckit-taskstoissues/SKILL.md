## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before tasks-to-issues conversion)**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_taskstoissues` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, do not skip silently: tell the user that `.specify/extensions.yml` could not be read (include the parser error) and that no hooks were checked, including any mandatory (`optional: false`) hooks registered there, then continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- When constructing command invocations from hook command names, replace dots (`.`) with hyphens (`-`). For example, `speckit.git.commit` → `/speckit-git-commit`.
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}

    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Outline.
    ```
    After emitting the block above you MUST actually invoke the hook and wait for it to finish before continuing. Run it the same way you would run the command yourself in this agent/session (the invocation may differ from the literal `{command}` id shown above, e.g. a skills-mode agent runs it as `/skill:speckit-...` or `$speckit-...`). Emitting the block alone does not run the hook.
- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Outline

1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").
1. **IF EXISTS**: Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for project principles and governance constraints.
1. From the executed script, extract the path to **tasks**. Also set `FEATURE_SLUG` to the basename of `FEATURE_DIR` (e.g. `FEATURE_DIR=/repo/specs/002-forecast-cli` → `FEATURE_SLUG=002-forecast-cli`). Every `tasks.md` restarts its task IDs at `T001`, so `FEATURE_SLUG` is what disambiguates this feature's `T001` from every other feature's `T001` in the steps below — without it, deduplication would silently match (and skip creating) this feature's issues against an unrelated feature's issues that happen to share the same bare ID.
1. Get the Git remote by running:

```bash
git config --get remote.origin.url
```

> [!CAUTION]
> ONLY PROCEED TO NEXT STEPS IF THE REMOTE IS A GITHUB URL

1. **Fetch existing issues for deduplication**: Before creating anything, build the set of task IDs you are about to process from `tasks.md` (each is a `T` followed by **at least** three digits, e.g. `T001` — `/speckit-converge` assigns new IDs with `T{M+1:03d}`, which is a floor rather than a cap, so once a file has more than 999 tasks the IDs are four digits or longer). Then use the GitHub MCP server's `list_issues` tool to look for issues that already cover those IDs. Do not pass a `state` value, since omitting it makes the tool return both open and closed issues. Request `perPage: 100` to keep the number of calls down, and since the tool uses cursor-based pagination, request pages with the `after` parameter (using the `endCursor` from the previous response).

   Every feature's `tasks.md` restarts at `T001`, so a bare task ID is **not** unique repo-wide — matching on it alone would treat another feature's `T001` issue as already covering this feature's `T001`, and silently skip creating it. Disambiguate by `FEATURE_SLUG` using **either** of these two matches per issue title:
   - **Scoped (current convention)**: `\[FEATURE_SLUG\]\s*T\d{3,}\b` — e.g. for `FEATURE_SLUG=002-forecast-cli`, a title of `[002-forecast-cli] T001: ...` matches, but `[001-throughput-forecast] T001: ...` or a bare `T001: ...` from a different feature does not.
   - **Legacy (pre-dating the scoped prefix)**: bare `\bT\d{3,}\b` (same digit-boundary rules as before) **and** the issue body contains the literal string `specs/FEATURE_SLUG/tasks.md` — covers issues created before this feature-scoping convention existed, which never got the bracket prefix. Checking the body means an extra fetch per bare-title candidate; only do this for titles that match the bare pattern but not the scoped one.

   Only mark an ID as already covered when one of these two matches succeeds for the current `FEATURE_SLUG` — a bare- or differently-scoped-matching title for a *different* feature is not a match. Stop paginating once every task ID is accounted for, or when there are no more pages.
1. For each task in the list, use the GitHub MCP server to create a new issue in the repository that is representative of the Git remote. Task lines in `tasks.md` start with a markdown checkbox, so first strip the leading `- [ ]` (and any `[P]` / `[US#]` markers) to recover the task ID and its description. Create the issue with a single canonical title of the form `[FEATURE_SLUG] T001: <description>` — the feature slug once, in brackets, then the ID, then the description (for example, with `FEATURE_SLUG=002-forecast-cli`, the line `- [ ] T001 Create project structure` becomes the title `[002-forecast-cli] T001: Create project structure`). Set the issue body to `Generated from specs/FEATURE_SLUG/tasks.md by /speckit-taskstoissues.` — this is what the legacy-matching fallback above checks for, so keep it exact.
   - **Skip** any task whose ID is already present in the set of existing issues from the previous step, and report it (for example, `T001 already has an issue, skipping`).
   - Only create issues for tasks that do not yet have a matching issue.

> [!CAUTION]
> UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES EVER CREATE ISSUES IN REPOSITORIES THAT DO NOT MATCH THE REMOTE URL

## Post-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (after tasks-to-issues conversion)**:
Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.after_taskstoissues` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, do not skip silently: tell the user that `.specify/extensions.yml` could not be read (include the parser error) and that no hooks were checked, including any mandatory (`optional: false`) hooks registered there, then continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- When constructing command invocations from hook command names, replace dots (`.`) with hyphens (`-`). For example, `speckit.git.commit` → `/speckit-git-commit`.
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
    ```
    After emitting the block above you MUST actually invoke the hook and wait for it to finish before continuing. Run it the same way you would run the command yourself in this agent/session (the invocation may differ from the literal `{command}` id shown above, e.g. a skills-mode agent runs it as `/skill:speckit-...` or `$speckit-...`).

# Specification Quality Checklist: Cycle Time Scatterplot with Percentile Lines

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-07
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed: the three judgment calls this spec makes
  (percentile method reuse, exact-date X axis with no bucketing, and the 5-item minimum
  sample size) each have a reasonable, low-risk default already established elsewhere in
  the product (the forecast Distribution view's percentile convention, and the existing
  zero-item empty-state pattern extended to a small-sample case). Recorded in Assumptions.
- All items pass; ready for `/speckit-plan`.
